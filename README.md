# T.H.U.V.U. — Tool for Heuristic Universal Versatile Usage

## Why this exists
I vibe-coded this agent in a few hours in order to better understand the mechanics of AI agents and see 
how far can I go by using local LLMs.

## Models and environment used
LM studio and qwen/qwen3-4b-2507 as the local LLM.

## How to test
I tested it by requesting it to create a Fibonacci calculation program. It created the project and it 
could build the code.

## Performance/Usage
It is somehow usable on my laptop running the LLM mainly on the CPU, on a Thinkpad L14 with ryzen 5 pro 4650U 
with 64 gigs of RAM, on windows 11.
The agent is far from perfect, but it is a humble start for a local AI agent.

## Why the name thuvu?
The name is a reference to the late and great Greek comedian Thanassis Veggos who made a 2 part film series 
where the main character (ΘΒ) Θου Βου (Thou Vou) was an aspiring secret agent, studying at the
secret agent school and messing up all the tasks he was assigned.
