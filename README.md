# CodingAgent

I vibe-coded this in a few hours in order to better understand the mechanics of AI agents. I am using LM studio and
and qwen/qwen3-4b-2507 as the local LLM.
I tested it by requesting it to create a Fibonacci calculation program. It created the project and it could build
the code
It is somehow usable on my laptop running the LLM mainly on the CPU, on a Thinkpad L14 with ryzen 5 pro 4650U with 
64 gigs of RAM, on windows 11.
